    <h4>Hello, my name is Cheyenne Potter. 
        I am a dual enrollment high school student attending both Michigan International Prep School (MIPS) and Adrian College. 
        I have a strong interest in coding and technology, which started when I was searching for a career that would support my dream of traveling full-time. 
        I am also the lead programmer for my former high school's FRC robotics team.

    <h4>Besides my passion for programming, I have many hobbies and interests I enjoy. 
        Music plays a big role in my lifeâ€”I love discovering new artists, exploring different genres, and going to concerts; there's something special about the energy of live performances.
        I also really enjoy reading, especially fantasy and romance, but I'm also drawn to books about mental health and personal experiences. I feel like reading gives me a deeper understanding of people and the world around me.
        Lastly, true crime fascinates me. I enjoy researching cases, learning how investigations unfold, and exploring the psychology behind criminal behavior.
